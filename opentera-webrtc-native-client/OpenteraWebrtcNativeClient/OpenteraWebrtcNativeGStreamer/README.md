# Licence

This component is licensed under different licenses depending on the files.

Some files were inspired by an implementation by Apple in the WebCore project, and are licensed under the LGPLv3, which is compatible with the original LGPLv2 license.
The files which depend on these are also licensed under the LGPLv3.

A few files are licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, just like the rest of the OpenTera WebRTC Native Client library.
These have no dependency whatsoever on the Apple files.

Every source file is identified with a header comment that contains the license.

The component as a whole is therefore licensed under the LGPLv3.
